### Small Practice: Yelp Businese Analysis
For the data above, answer a series of questions:
1. For each star count, 1-5, what percentage of restaurants receive that score on average?
What is the average word count of reviews that give each star count?

2. Each restaurant in our dataset is labeled with a number of categories, like “Sports Bars”,
“Coffee & Tea”, “Mexican”, or “Delis”. How many labels are there? How many restaurants of
each category label exist, and what is the mean score for restaurants with that label?

3. What are some common features of restaurants that receive higher-scoring reviews? This
can be extracted either from attributes of the restaurant itself or from the review texts.

The dataset "PA_reviews_full.json" is attached here. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HRVAQ0kUQ82uDzltq0NF-KRNfbl5y3o6/view?usp=sharing)
